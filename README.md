# Serial_LCD_Control

Ok, first thank you for checking this Visual Studio C# project out. It is early work and I haven't had time recently to make it better. However since I am getting such a great result I wanted to make this public sooner than later, so others could enjoy.

Shout out to [mathoudebine's project](https://github.com/mathoudebine/turing-smart-screen-python) for the basic library start. I roughly ported their work from Python to C# as the basis of this project.

The point of this particual project is to build a Windows XAML Application that can be used to add a simple display to servers and desktops that do not require a full HDMI display and extra port to work. There are a lot of ways to add status displays, but for me the idea of extending the desktop wasn't going to fly. So I took the excellent work of mathoudebine to create this simple application.

I am using the following parts below to make a simple LCD display for my test bench computer. All parts were obtained from Amazon, there should be enough detail to duplicate my setup. See the Thingiverse link for the 3d printed parts needed to mount the screen.

- 1ea 3.5inch Turing Smart Screen, e.g. from WOWNOVA 
- 2ea 30mm M3 screws and T-Nuts
- 1ea U shaped, 180 degree USB cable, e.g. from GELRHONR 
- 1ea USB header to USB Cable, e.g. from Duttek
